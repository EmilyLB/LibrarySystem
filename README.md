# LibrarySystem
Viable Data technical test.
Using Python 3.11.4

The library system can be accessed by running the file: LibrarySystem.py
- You can interact with the library system via the command line.

The library database is an sqlite database stored in the file: librarydb.sqlite

The database can be edited from the file: databaseSetup.py (however, it is already setup so you do not need to run this file before running LibrarySystem.py)

I have already added two users to the database, the login details are:

User1
- Username: anemail@address.com
- Password: password22

User2
- Username: np@address.com
- Password: abc

These users have books on loan allowing you to see that functionality working. You can add new users as well, at the start of the program.

For displaying the pictures of the books I used matplotlib. To view each available image, you will need to close the current image window that pops up.
